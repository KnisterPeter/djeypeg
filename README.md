A PEG parser generator written in xtend.

jpeg is based on the ideas of Ford (http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/thesis/)
and extend like Warth et al. described (http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~todd/research/pepm08.pdf) to support left-recursion.

TODO
====
* support indirect left-recursion
* unordered groups
* Cross-References (maybe)
* Import of grammars
* Overriding of rules
* AST-to-AST transformation
